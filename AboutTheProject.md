Object Localization is the task of locating an instance of a particular object category in an image, typically by specifying a tightly cropped bounding box centered on the instance.In this project,understood the Object Localization Dataset and wrote a custom dataset class for Image-bounding box dataset. Applied augmentation for localization task to augment images as well as its effect on bounding box, using albumentation library. Plotted the (image-bounding box) pair. Loaded a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network using timm library. Create train function and evaluator function used further to write training loop. Lastly,used best trained model to find bounding box given any image.
